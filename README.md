# Tools ðŸª›

**Server:** Node, Express \
**Headless Browser:** Puppeteer

# Setup

- Clone repo
- Install all dependencies, run `yarn` .
- Create a `.env` file in the root repository and set all required variables (ie. **PORT**)
- Create an `assets` folder inside of the `src` folder
- Start project by running `yarn start`

# Testing

- Set up `jest.config.js` to suit you

```js
module.exports = {
  preset: "ts-jest",
  testEnvironment: "node",
  transformIgnorePatterns: ["^.+\\.js$"],
  testPathIgnorePatterns: ["<rootDir>/build"],
};
```

- Run `yarn test`

- **Synchronous Pattern** \
  Hit API endpoint with payload, request is processed and response is sent to the API user accorndingly.
- **Asynchronous Pattern**
  Hit API with payload, response `application queued` sent to the API user, worker in the background Submits Jobs and then Updates the API user with new response accordingly.

# API

## Enpoint

`POST /forms/frontier/applications`

## Payload

```json
{
  "firstname": "Test",
  "lastname": "Lastname",
  "phone": "+1 234 234 0000",
  "location": "London, UK",
  "linkedin": "linkedin.com/profile/me",
  "resume": "https://frontier-public-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05oo7evmr4hsc7ufvmdcpojlh1ki1rd3benjo0g1_Brian_CV.docx",
  "email": "yupp@test.com",
  "worked_remote": "No",
  "worked_startup": "No"
}
```

## Expected Response

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "application submitted"
}

//or something of this structure
```

# Thoughts

- **Overview :**
  This was an interesting challenge, albeit straightforward it was interesting to tackle and see what decisions I will make. (Definetely a lot of optimizations here and there)

- **Challenges :**
  Working out a solution for the Location Field on the form. That took ~50% of the time spent on thhis
- **Improvements ?:**
  None .

# Time Spent

It took approximately 6hrs to get a stable working solution with 3 (~2hr) sessions
